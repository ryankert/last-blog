## Fibonacci Number

[509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

### An Ordinary Approach: Dynamic Programming

using ```F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.``` that has been given to calculate ```F[0] to F[n]```, and then return ```F[n]```.

**code:**

```cpp
int fib(int n) {
	if(n <= 1) return n;
	vector<int>F(n+1);
	F[0] = 0;
	F[1] = 1;
	for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
		F[i] = F[i-1] + F[i-2];
	return F[n];
}
```

Already pretty fast, in my case, ```0ms```.
**Time complexity:** ```O(n)```



but it can be even faster! By using matrix.

### Base Idea: Matrix

this solution is from [archit91](https://leetcode.com/archit91/)

**Observation:** Basically, we have a Matrix ```M = [[1,1],[1,0]]```, and ```pow(M, n)```, gives us that fibonacci number at ```M[0][0]```.
